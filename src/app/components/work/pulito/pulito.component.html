    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>In June 2018, I entered the <a href="https://59daysofcode.org/" target="_blank" class="59doc">59DaysOfCode</a> competition with fellow Geekwise Cohort 
      Members: <a href="https://github.com/pakawaka1" target="_blank">David Cervantes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dramirez2096" target="_blank">David Ramirez</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/ayojackay" target="_blank">Jacque Solano</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Fleury14" target="_blank">J.R. Ruggiero</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/ChristaFox" target="_blank">Christa Fox</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brandynm34" target="_blank">Brandy Moreno</a>. 
      We entered the Ignite track and the track's goal was for competitors to use tech to create sustainable cities. We were given the task of finding solutions to problems 
      that cities faced here in the Central Valley. Within 59 days, we created <a href="http://pulito.co/" target="_blank">Pulito</a>, a 
      mobile app that addresses the trash and recycling problem in Fresno.</p>

  <div class="planning">
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>First began brain storming problems that had affected the Central Valley and the cities that were in it. We began to think of problems that could affect local cities within the Central 
      Valley. Soon we thought the Central Valley itself was too large to cover so we instead shifted our focus to Fresno. While we had discussed many different issues that were going on within the city of Fresno, the ones that we thought that had the most impact were the ongoing water issues and ways to bring tech to help the water crisis, ways of dealing with homeless/poverty and ways to treat the pollution from farm equipment. But we ultimately decided to focus on the trash and recycling issue that's in Fresno.</p>

  <div class="implementation">
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>To get something out within 59 days, we decided that a phone app would be best suited for this project. We came to a conclusion that there would be three main features that our app would have.</p>
    <ol class="three-features">
      <li>A map and list of local recyling centers and landfill sites so users know where to take their waste.</li>
      <li>Reporting page so users can alert each other of areas in their city that need cleaning.</li>
      <li>Stats page that allows users to visually see how much they have contributed to clean.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We decided to use the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> framework because most of the team has experience using Angular 2+ and thought the transition would be smooth. To create our reporting page and we decided to use Firebase where we would store users messages where places would needed to be cleaned up. </p>
